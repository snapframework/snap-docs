snap-docs
=========

A repository for compileable literate Haskell documentation.  The idea is to
create a place where we can put comprehensive tutorials and other
documentation for the Snap Framework.  If we follow the style used
[here](https://github.com/snapframework/heist/tree/master/test/suite/Heist/Tutorial),
we can ensure that all our documentation can be compiled while still being
able to use pandoc to generate HTML for presentation.

There are a few bits and pieces that have already been written.  Most of that
has been stored on github wikis for the
[heist](https://github.com/snapframework/heist/wiki/_pages) and
[snap](https://github.com/snapframework/snap/wiki/_pages) packages.
Ultimately that content should be moved here.
